prompt.prompt = "In CAP theorem, which component is mandatory in distributed systems?"
prompt.distractors = ["Consistency", "Availability", "Partition Tolerance"]
answer.answer = "Partition Tolerance"
context = "Partition tolerance is not optional—network partitions WILL happen in distributed systems. The real choice is between C and A during a partition."

prompt.prompt = "What consistency model guarantees that if no new updates are made, eventually all accesses will return the last updated value?"
answer.answer = "eventual consistency"
context = "Eventual consistency means the system converges over time. If updates stop, all replicas eventually agree. Great for availability, weaker than strong consistency."
