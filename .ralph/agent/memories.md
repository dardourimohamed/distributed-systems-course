> mdbook-mermaid fix: To render mermaid diagrams in mdBook, create book.js in project root that loads mermaid.js from CDN and calls mermaid.run(). Configure with additional-js = ["book.js"] under [output.html] in book.toml. The preprocessor only converts to <pre class="mermaid"> HTML elements, it doesn't include the rendering library.
